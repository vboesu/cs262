    "### Conclusion\n",
    "**Overall**: After some initial orientation, gRPC was relatively easy to use. VBS is not the biggest fan of the interface–because it works across many different platforms, it doesn't feel very Pythonic. However, the push notification system was a bit of a pain (like in the first exercise), and maybe we haven't fully understood yet what the most native way to implement it using gRPC would be. Could also be an artefact of the way in which Google uses gRPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Overall, it makes the application a little simpler since we no longer have to worry about encoding, sending, receiving, and parsing requests. gRPC does all of this for us. We were able to remove a few files relating to our wire protocol and the handling of sockets. But of course you give away some flexibility to gRPC which we may have wanted at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size**: The data being sent around is minimal which is to be expected from a strongly typed protocol. The difference to our own wire protocol are quite stark since we decided to use a very flexible wire protocol which does not require any typing at all (a rather Pythonic approach to the exercise if you will). If bandwidth is an issue, then we should definitely consider using either gRPC or at least modify our wire protocol to have static field names and types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: The structure of the client did not change all that much, we mostly just had to replace the construction of requests sent to the server. The thread responsible for receiving push notifications is a little bit different but not too much. We were able to get rid of the central socket handler which took care of assigning responses to the requests or handling push notifications. The server also largely remained the same, we had to do some trickery to keep our framework with different response types specific to each operation. Especially the stream response was a bit annoying to code, we had to create a fake generator class basically in case anything goes wrong. Not ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing**: Since our previous tests were mostly about the correctness of our wire protocol and the requests we were sending around, those tests are now superfluous–we're trusting the gRPC test suite. We should therefore probably implement API function and/or UI testing. The latter seems really annoying but the former could be helpful, especially if we use mock databases etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UPDATE on Testing**: We decided to implement some more tests, both for the client and for the server. In particular, we're testing the server's actions by using a mock DB, manually creating the gRPC requests and then just skipping the step of actually sending the requests, rather inputting them directly. This now tests our API pretty extensively. The tests aren't really all that specific to gRPC, the only thing we had to take care of was to create the correct request classes for each of the tests. We decided to use the actual gRPC request classes but we could have also created dummy copies of them; this way just seemed to introduce less stuff that we would need to adjust manually if we ever change the gRPC protocol."
