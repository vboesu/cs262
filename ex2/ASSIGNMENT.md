### Design exercise 2: RPC

Re-implement the chat application you built for the first design exercise, but replace using sockets and a custom wire protocol/JSON with gRPC or some similar RPC package. Does the use of this tool make the application easier or more difficult? What does it do to the size of the data passed? How does it change the structure of the client? The server? How does this change the testing of the application?
