    "Goal: develop a replicated, distributed database system which supports both strongly consistent data and eventually consistent data. The idea is that writes and reads can be directed to any of the replicated databases, with consistency guarantees only for those tables/columns marked as strongly consistent."

    "- We need to use non-sequenced primary keys to make sure that foreign keys can be made to work\n",
    "- At what level do we implement the consistency requirements? Do we just create separate servers, each with their own database, that receive instructions via sockets?\n",
    "- Queries that involve columns/tables of mixed consistency requirements are difficult\n",
    "- Do we send the replication before or after the commit on the first replica? -> Has to be before to avoid rolling back a transaction\n",
    "- Can every replica initiate a strongly consistent transaction or do we have a leader to whom those transactions are forwarded?\n",
    "- How can we do Python defaults at a transaction level (e.g. set the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to be the same for all objects in a transaction without going back and forth to the database)?\n",
    "- How can we make sure that only the columns/tables affected by a transaction are \"locked\" for the duration of a strong transaction?"
