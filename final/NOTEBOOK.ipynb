    "- We need to use non-sequenced primary keys to make sure that foreign keys can be made to work\n",
    "- At what level do we implement the consistency requirements? Do we just create separate servers, each with their own database, that receive instructions via sockets?\n",
    "- Queries that involve columns/tables of mixed consistency requirements are difficult\n",
    "- Do we send the replication before or after the commit on the first replica? -> Has to be before to avoid rolling back a transaction\n",
    "- Can every replica initiate a strongly consistent transaction or do we have a leader to whom those transactions are forwarded?\n",
    "    - Edge case: a strongly consistent column only gets changed by `onupdate` (or `default`), especially bad in case where this is a timestamp (now why would you ever do that, I'm not sure)\n",
    "- How can we do Python defaults at a transaction level (e.g. set the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to be the same for all objects in a transaction without going back and forth to the database)?\n",
    "- How can we make sure that only the columns/tables affected by a transaction are \"locked\" for the duration of a strong transaction?"
