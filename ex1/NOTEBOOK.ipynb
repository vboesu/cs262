    "\n",
    "- Use TCP/IP as template\n",
    "    - Do we need IP addresses in the header?\n",
    "    - How can we verify packets?\n",
    "- VBS: Should we use some kind of compression for the message contents?\n",
    "    - VBS: Maybe not, let's keep it simple\n",
    "- Header (8 bytes):\n",
    "    - Version (1 byte)\n",
    "    - Request code (think: HTTP status code but also use this to specify the operation) (1 byte)\n",
    "    - Flags/status (2 bytes) -> for the future, also padding\n",
    "    - Packet checksum (2 bytes)\n",
    "    - Payload length (2 bytes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What type of data are we sending across?\n",
    "    - Operations + arguments (e.g. page/pagination, optional arguments)\n",
    "    - Strings (e.g. name, password hash, error messages)\n",
    "    - Status code (from the server to detect errors)\n",
    "    - Arrays of strings -> could be sent as string of strings separated by commas like a CSV\n",
    "        - VBS: we need to allow for commas in a string, should we just use ascii and then have a special non-ascii character for either both end of string and end of item or a separate one for end of item and end of string, kind of like '\\0' in C?\n",
    "        - Let's not use this. Let's use another, more flexible encoding instead\n",
    "    - Assuming that we never need to send over dictionaries but at most lists, we can use an encoding for \"fields\" like this:\n",
    "        - Field ID (1 byte), Field Length (2 bytes), Field Value (bytes)\n",
    "        - This would mean that the client and server need to agree on which field ID corresponds to which field (e.g. username -> ID 1 etc.), and -- importantly -- what the *type* of each field is (e.g. float, string, unsigned int/int, list of float/string etc.); also, there are only 2^8 = 255 possible fields we can use which should be enough for this application but may cause issues in the future if there is a lot of data that we need to transmit\n",
    "            - One possible workaround for this is to have an \"OTHER\" value kind of like in UTF-8 where if the first bit is set, you actually read 2 bytes for the field ID and use that as your index; this would be much more flexible but also more work to implement\n",
    "        - Do we want to allow lists of different types? Probably not necessary\n",
    "        - Side note: we can store the types efficiently using some byte flag for \"list\" and then different byte values for the type, and then check if \"list & type\" is 1 to detect that it's a list\n",
    "        - We should agree that we're using little-endian for all communication\n",
    "            - Is there any way to define flexible length types, e.g. specify \"int\" but then allow 8-byte integers?\n",
